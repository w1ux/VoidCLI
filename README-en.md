# VoidCLI - What is it?
VoidCLI is my very first Python project. VoidCLI is similar to Linux, but it isn't Linux. I'm developing it alone, sometimes asking DeepSeek for help. If you'd like to contribute to VoidCLI - feel free! I'd be happy about it. I will try to keep an eye on the forks of my project and see what can be added to the next version of VoidCLI.

# Can you help me with development?
To be honest, I'm not sure yet. I might abandon this project. But if a new version comes out, then sure, you can!
